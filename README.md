### Welcome on my profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am a High School student, learning programming on my own. In past, I mostly focused on getting knowledge in Node.JS with Express, TypeScript. **Back-end** > **Front-end** ðŸ˜„

Now, I am also into **Mobile-Apps**. I have just started my adventure with **Flutter & Dart** and in future, I would love to focus around my own Application.
*In fact, I already have a good idea for it, hopefully it is going to work out... :-)* 
    
<p> I have started my journey with programming in October 2019. First steps were tough...</p>

**I plan to make some cool repositories, so hopefully everyone will find any useful line of code for himself!** âœ‹
