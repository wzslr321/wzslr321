### Welcome on my profile! 👋

I am a High School student, learning programming on my own. I have tried to get a knowledge in C#, C++, Python basics, but...
    There is no other such a good language as <b> Javascript, especially Node.js 😎 </b>
    
<p> I have started my journey with programming in October 2019. First steps were tough...</p>

<p> After a year, my skill has improved, and my pages finally do not look like a total crap! </p>
<img src = "/wzslr321/images/readmeimage2.png" width = 50% height = 50%>
<p> I prefer back-end coding, with Node.js, but I want to become <b> MERN </b> full stack developer, so I have to get into React. I already have spent  a dozen hours with TypeScript, and it wasn`t so bad 😏 </p>

<p> I plan to make some cool repositories, so hopefully everyone will find any useful line of code for himself ✋
