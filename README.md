<p> I am a Computer Science student @ Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Warsaw, Poland. I currently work full-time as a Flutter Developer. I am more of an extrovert, but I love peaceful evenings, romanticizing programming in neovim with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2WDdccgaDY"> Rainbow Kitten Surprise </a> playing in the background. I may appear to be a little weird at first, because I sometimes talk insanely fast and get lost in my simultaneous thoughts, but bear with me in such a case, and I am sure you won't regret it (okay, I can't guarantee that, but I really hope that'd be the case) </p>

 I am a <i>Jack of all trades, master of none</i> type of guy. Although, I want to find something, that I will get completely lost in. I don't really know what I will do in life - maybe I will get a Ph.D., maybe not finish any degree at all. Perhaps I will work at Google and live in a big city or a small seaside village where everyone knows each other. Nonetheless, I am incredibly fascinated about the future and I wake up with a smile almost every day because every day, I do things that at this moment excite me the most and I don't care if someone sees me as a hypocrite for switching subjects.

<b> Fun facts about me </b>

- In the end of 2019 I didn't know how to install Windows, and I formatted a USB with .iso instead of a hard drive...
- I wanted to start programming when I was 13, but the complexity of Fibonacci algorithm in C++ scared me enough to give up for the next two years
- I failed to get into Deep Learning 5 times now and 5th attempt definitely wasn't the last one
