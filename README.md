<p> I am a  High School student who learns programming on his own. In the past, I have mostly focused on getting knowledge and experience in Web Development. In 2020-2021 I've been mainly focusing on <b> Mobile Development with Flutter </b>. When it comes to complex <i> <b> Back-End </i>, Golang </b> was my favourite choice, although I am not such a masochist to choose it over simplicity, which <b> Firebase </b> provides! I strongly believe that correct selection of the tool for the task is one of the most important programmer's skills! </p>

<i> For at least the next year, starting in September 2021 I want to try my best in fully commiting myself to C++ and Competetive Programming. I also realised how important mathematics is and I am going to progress in it as much as it is possible. I want to participate in <b>O</b>lympiad of <b>I</b>nformatics. No matter on result, I am sure that every minute spent on preparations will be a good used minute. It will definitely give me a strong foundations for <b> Machine Learning </b>  which is my dream path of career. </i>

<p> I am not a big fan of being only a 'code writer', that's the reason why I've been learning basics of <i> Assembly </i> language. I want to understand truely
how the computer works, so I can code much better optimalized applications! I also can't wait to get hands on embedded stuff- logical gates seem awesome!
I believe that nowadays, when new programming languages aim for a higher level of abstraction, we all should stop for a minute to examine how things work underneath. 
<b> Programming skills shouldn't be defined by how many problem solutions we do remember, but how many solutions we are ready to create. </b>

#

- ðŸ’£ I try my hand at writing articles on <a href="https://wiktorzajac.medium.com"> <i> Medium </i> </a> 

- âš¡ Fun fact: In the end of 2019 I didn't know how to install Windows, and I formatted USB with .iso instead of hard drive...
- âš¡ Fun fact #2: I wanted to start programming when I was 15, but complexity of Fibonacci alghoritm in C++ scared me enough to give up for the next 2 years.
