<p> I am a Computer Science student @ PJAIT and I work full-time as a Flutter Developer. </p>
<p>
 <b>Neovim</b> is the only valid choice for writing code. 
</p>

I am rather a <i>Jack of all trades, master of none</i> type of guy, though I know Flutter & Dart pretty well
after few years spent with it. 

Currently trying to build some cool stuff for devs, using Rust
