<p> I am a High School student, graduating in May 2023. In school, I focus mainly on math, but do not get me mistaken - I am not good at it. I work part-time as a Mobile Developer, building end-to-end Android/iOS applications with Flutter & Firebase. I am more of an extrovert, but I love peaceful evenings in my cozy reading area with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U4opbXoMss"> The Smashing Pumpkins </a> playing in the background. As a teenager, I of course also love to party - can't wait to go to a rave in Warsaw, when I move there in a few months. Apart from all of that, I am primarily interested in creating new projects and not finishing them ðŸŒš</p>

 I am a <i>Jack of all trades, master of none</i> type of guy. A lot of people said to me that it is bad, that I'm not an expert in any technology, as a programmer, but I don't really care. I used to be mad at myself for not finishing any projects, but I came to love it. The universe is way too amazing to be interested only in one thing. I like the phrase "Who I want to become, depends on what series I am currently watching." Software engineering and neuroscience appealed the most to me so far. I don't really know what I will do in life - maybe I will get a Ph.D., maybe not finish any degree at all. Perhaps I will work at Google and live in a big city, or live in a small seaside village where everyone knows each other. Nonetheless, I am incredibly fascinated about the future and I wake up with a smile almost every day because every day, I do things that at this moment excite me the most and I don't care if someone sees me as a hypocrite for switching subjects. I disagree with the statement that it is harder for smart people to be happy - I feel like the more I know about the world, it gets easier. Everyone's actions and thoughts can be explained, so instead of getting upset or confused, we can just try our best to understand them, or at least convince ourselves that we do. <b> Carpe Diem! </b>

<b> Fun facts about me </b>

- In the end of 2019 I didn't know how to install Windows, and I formatted USB with .iso instead of hard drive...
- I wanted to start programming when I was 13, but complexity of Fibonacci alghoritm in C++ scared me enough to give up for the next two years
- I failed to get into Deep Learning 5 times now and 5th attempt definitely wasn't the last one
